# contact_graspnet
- needs ">=8GB of VRAM" for inference, so this might be challenging
- "mamba create -f contact_graspnet_env.yaml" fails with "coukd not resolve environment"
- use python==3.7.9 to still use python3.7 under which contact graspnet was tested but still be us uch up to date as possible
